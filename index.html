                    <p>I'm Benjamin, a second-year MComp Computer Science student at the University of Sheffield. I'm driven by a genuine curiosity for how things work, whether that's the mathematics underpinning computation, the structure of a spoken language, or the architecture of a system designed to solve a real problem.</p>

                    <p>At university I lead the AI team on Project Echo, where we're developing machine learning solutions for noise reduction in hearing aids. I also serve as the project's finance lead, giving me experience across both the technical and operational sides of bringing an idea to life. My current academic work spans formal logic, graph theory, and software engineering with real industry clients through Sheffield's Software Hut module.</p>

                    <p>Outside of computer science, I'm a dedicated student of Mandarin Chinese — a language I've studied for years and consider central to who I am. I believe the discipline of learning a language and the rigour of learning to program share more in common than people think: both demand patience, pattern recognition, and a willingness to sit with confusion until clarity arrives.</p>

                    <p>I care about building things that matter, communicating complex ideas clearly, and approaching every problem with intention. I'm currently exploring opportunities in technology consulting where I can combine technical depth with the kind of structured, human-centred thinking that turns good solutions into real impact.</p>

                <h2>Project Echo</h2>
                <p>Hearing aids have long struggled to effectively filter unwanted environmental noise while preserving the clarity of speech. For millions of users, busy environments like restaurants, public transport, and workplaces render their devices frustrating rather than helpful. Traditional noise suppression methods often degrade speech quality in the process, forcing users to choose between hearing everything or missing what matters.</p>

                <p>As AI Team Lead on Project Echo, I directed the research and development of a machine learning pipeline designed to tackle this problem. This involved evaluating existing noise reduction approaches, identifying their shortcomings, and designing an architecture that could separate speech from complex, overlapping noise sources in real time. I coordinated a team of developers, setting technical direction while managing timelines and project finances as finance lead.</p>

                <p>The solution we developed used AI-driven audio processing to intelligently distinguish speech from background noise, preserving natural voice characteristics while suppressing environmental interference. The system was designed with the constraints of hearing aid hardware in mind, prioritising low latency and computational efficiency so that the model could realistically be deployed on embedded devices rather than existing only as a research prototype.</p>

                <p>The project was presented to IBM representatives and showcased at an industrial exhibition, receiving strong interest from industry professionals. Beyond the technical outcomes, leading Project Echo sharpened my ability to communicate complex technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders and to manage a team through ambiguous, research-driven problems where the path forward wasn't always clear.</p>
