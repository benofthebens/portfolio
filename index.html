                    <h3 class="about-heading">About Me</h3>
                    <p>I'm Benjamin, a second-year MComp Computer Science student at the University of Sheffield. I'm driven by curiosity for how things work, or the architecture of a system designed to solve a real problem.</p>

                    <p>At university I am leading the AI team on Project Echo,
                        where we're developing machine learning solutions for noise reduction in hearing aids. I also serve as the project's finance lead,
                        giving me experience across both the technical and finance.
                        My current academic work spans is formal logic,
                        graph theory, and software engineering with real industry clients through Sheffield's Software Hut module.</p>

                    <p>Outside of computer science, I'm a dedicated student of Mandarin Chinese a language I've studied for years and consider central to who I am.
                        I believe the discipline of learning a language and the rigour of learning to program share more in common than people think:
                        both demand patience, pattern recognition, and a willingness to sit with confusion until the problem is solved.</p>

                    <p>I care about building things that matter,
                        communicating complex ideas clearly,
                        and approaching every problem with intention. I
                        'm currently exploring opportunities in technology consulting where I can combine technical depth with the kind of structured,
                        human-centred thinking that turns good solutions into real impact.</p>

                <p>
                    Hearing aids have long struggled to effectively filter unwanted environmental noise while preserving the clarity of speech.
                    For millions of users, busy environments like restaurants, public transport, and workplaces render their devices frustrating rather than helpful.
                    Traditional noise suppression methods often degrade speech quality in the process,
                    forcing users to choose between hearing everything or missing important parts.</p>

                <p>As AI Team Lead on Project Echo,
                   I am directing the research and development of a machine learning pipeline designed to tackle this problem.
                    This involved evaluating existing noise reduction approaches, identifying their shortcomings,
                    and designing an architecture that could separate speech from complex,
                    overlapping noise sources in real time. I coordinated a team of developers,
                    setting technical direction while managing timelines and project finances as finance lead.</p>

                <p>I presented this project to IBM representatives at an industrial showcase,
                    receiving strong interest from industry professionals.
                    Beyond the technical outcomes, leading Project Echo sharpened my ability to
                    communicate complex technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders and presenting skills.
